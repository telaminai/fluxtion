/**
 * Marks a method to be invoked in the after event phase of event processing. A SEP
 * processes event handling methods in two phases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Event in phase - processes handler methods in topological order
 * <li>After event phase - processes handler methods in reverse topological
 * order
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An OnEventComplete method will be called after all dependents have finished
 * processing any
 * after event phase methods. OnEventComplete methods are only called if the
 * following
 * conditions are met:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An event in phase handler is present in the same instance
 * <li>An event in phase handler is on the current execution path.
 * </ul>
