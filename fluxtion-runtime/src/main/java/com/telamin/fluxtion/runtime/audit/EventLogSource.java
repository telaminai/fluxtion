/**
 * Marker interface for nodes that want to participate in structured audit logging.
 * <p>
 * How to get an EventLogger at runtime:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implement this interface on your node, or</li>
 *   <li>Extend {@link EventLogNode}, which already implements this interface and exposes a protected
 *   {@code auditLog} field for convenience.</li>
 * </ul>
 * During graph initialisation the {@link EventLogManager} discovers all EventLogSource instances and
 * injects a configured {@link EventLogger} by calling {@link #setLogger(EventLogger)}. Before injection
 * the logger defaults to a {@link NullEventLogger} and safely discards writes.
 * <p>
 * Once injected, the node can write key/value pairs in its lifecycle or event handler methods, while
 * the EventLogManager aggregates and emits per-node records in topological execution order.
