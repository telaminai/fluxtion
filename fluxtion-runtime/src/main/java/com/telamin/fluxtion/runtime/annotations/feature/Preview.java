/**
 * Marks a class or method as a preview feature. Mirrors the use of jdk preview features:
 * <p/>
 * A preview feature is a new feature of the Java language, Java Virtual Machine, or Java SE API that is fully specified,
 * fully implemented, and yet impermanent. It is available in a JDK feature release to provoke developer feedback based
 * on real world use; this may lead to it becoming permanent in a future Java SE Platform.
