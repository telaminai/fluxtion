/**
 * Marks a method to be called in a node when a dependency has processed an
 * event. Identifying which parent has changed can be useful when a node has
 * multiple dependencies on differing execution paths.
 * OnParentUpdate gives more granular notification than OnEvent, by identifying
 * which parents have updated. The marked method has a single argument, the type
 * of the parent.<p>
 * <p>
 * The marked method(s) will be invoked during the event in phase before any
 * {@link OnTrigger} methods in this node are invoked.
 * <p>
 * A SEP processes event handling methods in two phases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Event in phase - processes handler methods in topological order
 * <li>After event phase - processes handler methods in reverse topological
 * order
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Parent resolution</h2>
 * The type of the argument in the OnParentUpdate method is used to
 * resolve the parent to monitor. Optionally a {@link #value()} specifies the
 * field name of the parent to monitor. If multiple parents exist within this
 * class of the same type, type resolution is non-deterministic, specifying the
 * value predictably determines which parent is monitored.
 *
 * <h2>collections</h2>
 * If the OnParentUpdate method points to a collection, the instance inside the
 * collection that is updated will be passed to the method as an argument. As
 * multiple instances inside a collection maybe updated in an execution cycle,
 * the same OnParentUpdate method may be called multiple times in that cycle.
