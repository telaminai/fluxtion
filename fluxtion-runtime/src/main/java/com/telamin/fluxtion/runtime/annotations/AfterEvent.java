/**
 * Marks a method to be invoked in the after event phase of event processing. A SEP
 * processes event handling methods in two phases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Event in phase - processes handler methods in topological order
 * <li>After event phase - processes handler methods in reverse topological order
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An AfterEvent method will be called after all dependents have finished processing any
 * after event phase methods. AfterEvent handlers are always called regardless of the incoming
 * event.
