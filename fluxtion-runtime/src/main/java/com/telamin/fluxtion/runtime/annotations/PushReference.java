/**
 * Marks a member that is part of the node set in the SEP as a push reference.
 * Normally the event wave starts at the target of the reference and then
 * notifies the source of the reference. A push reference inverts the event wave
 * so the source of the reference is notified before the target. This allows the
 * source to push data onto the target. Event notification of the target will occur
 * after the push.
