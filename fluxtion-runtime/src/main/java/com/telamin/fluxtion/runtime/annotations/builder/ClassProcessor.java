/**
 * A ClassProcessor service can inspect and process application classes after
 * they are compiled. The callback {@link #process(URL) } points to the
 * compiled application classes. No external libraries are on the process URL,
 * solely the output of compiling application source files.<p>
 * <p>
 * This gives the opportunity for {@link ClassProcessor}'s to scan the path and
 * generate artifacts without risk of confusing library and application classes.
 * For example a service may scan for a specific annotation and generate a
 * tailored solution based on the meta-data discovered during scanning.<p>
 *
 * <h2>Registering ClassProcessor</h2>
 * Fluxtion employs the {@link ServiceLoader} pattern to register user
 * implemented NodeFactories. Please read the java documentation describing the
 * meta-data a node implementor must provide to register a node using the
 * {@link ServiceLoader} pattern.
