/**
 * Represents a node that triggers scheduled actions using a {@link SchedulerService}.
 * This node extends {@link AbstractCallbackNode}, enabling it to fire callback events.
 * It supports scheduling events to occur after a specified delay. When the timer expires this node is the root of a
 * new event cycle.
 *
 * This class is marked as {@link Experimental}, meaning its features are subject to
 * change and its API should be used with caution in production environments.
