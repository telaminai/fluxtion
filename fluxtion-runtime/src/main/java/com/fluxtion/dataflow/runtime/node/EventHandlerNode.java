/**
 * Acts as the root of an execution path in a {@link DataFlow}. A
 * user implements this class and registers it with the static event compiler,
 * to generate a DataFlow. Events will be routed to an instance of
 * this class by the generated DataFlow at runtime.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <h2>Filtering</h2>
 * An EventHandler can optionally provide a filter value to filter the
 * events that are accepted for processing. Usually the match is based solely
 * on event type to determine if instance of a FilteredEventHandler is on the
 * execution path for an event, filtering can further refine the match.
 * <p>
 *
 * An {@link Event} can optionally specify a filter value as an int {@link Event#filterId()
 * } or as a String {@link Event#filterString() . The SEP will compare the filter
 * values in the {@link Event} and the handler and propagate the Event conditional upon the a match.
 * .<p>
 *
 * Default values for filters indicate only match on type, no filters are applied:
 * <ul>
 * <li>int filter : Integer.MAX_VALUE = no filtering</li>
 * <li>String filter : null or "" = no filtering</li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Child instances that refer to this instance receive update callbacks by invoking marking a method with an {@link OnTrigger }
 * annotation or implementing the {@link TriggeredNode} interface
 *
