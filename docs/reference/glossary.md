## Key terms

| Term                 | Description                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Event                | An event is any valid java instance that is submitted to the DataFlow                                                                     |
| Stream               | A stream is a unbounded flow of events                                                                                                    |
| DataFlow             | Processes the event stream with user defined logic. A DataFlow instance is generated by DataFlowBuilder                                   |
| Node                 | A pojo instance that is managed within an DataFlow                                                                                        |
| Event propagation    | Invoking methods in a topological order on nodes within a DataFlow                                                                        |
| Event handler method | A method on a node that is an entry point for processing an external event                                                                |
| Trigger method       | A method on a node that is triggered once all parent nodes have completed their trigger methods                                           |
| Event notification   | Trigger or event handler methods notify a change by returning a boolean flag to control event propagation                                 |
| Graph space          | Construction of the meta model occurs in graph space, before generating the DataFlow and after the user has provided all node information |
