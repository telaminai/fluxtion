# DataFlow use cases
---

Fluxtion supports all the functionality of a stream processing engine and can be used in many situations. As the world
has moved to expect real time responses the requirements to deploy stream processing is now a requirement. A busineess
that relies on end of day batch processing is not positioned for today's customer demands.

* Real time pricing
* Inventory management
* Realtime monitoring and system control
* Low latency algo trading
* Realtime offers
* Fraud detection
* Ai integration for realtime decsison making
* Data pipelines batch and realtime
* Realtime data cleansing
* Risk compliance and trade control
* Realtime stream processing
* Event driven microservices
* Edge AI processing

# Freedom and power for real-time business

**Take control of your real-time data processing with Fluxtion.** Unlike other solutions that lock you into a specific
messaging system, Fluxtion offers unmatched flexibility and vendor neutrality.

**Focus on what matters most - your core business logic.**  Fluxtion keeps your business logic separate from the underlying
messaging infrastructure. This means you can easily switch messaging providers without rewriting code, giving you the
freedom to choose the best solution for your needs.


## Fluxtion is tailor-made for organisations seeking
