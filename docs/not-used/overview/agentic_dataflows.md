Fluxtion DataFlow supports all the functionality of a stream processing engine and also integrates agents seamlessly. 
DataFlow observes the world from event streams, the agents change the outside world. DataFlows provide the following 
agent support

- Multiple agents can be hosted in a DataFlow
- Agents can depend on multiple agents in a DataFlow
- Agens can depend on any native DataFlow monitor
- Agents can be directly controlled at runtime from outside the DataFlow
- Fully optional behaviour is supported
- Designed to run autonomously in low power devices
- Fully audit logs are recorded for decision making
- ML inference can be embedded in the DataFlow to drive agent behaviour
- Agents are custom written or re-used from an external supplier
- Integrating agents is zero cost
- A single DataFlow can host thousands of agents
